# 🏠 AI-Powered House Price Prediction System

### End-to-End Machine Learning Project with Deployment on Google Cloud Run
---

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is an **end-to-end Machine Learning system** that predicts house prices in Bangalore using advanced regression models. It covers the full ML lifecycle — from data preprocessing and model building to API development, containerization, and cloud deployment.
The system is designed to simulate a **real-world production ML pipeline**, making it suitable as a capstone project for Data Science and Machine Learning roles.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Real estate price prediction is a complex task due to multiple influencing factors such as location, size, number of bedrooms, and amenities.

👉 Goal:
Build a robust ML model to accurately predict house prices based on structured input features.
